  predgovor1: "Studio: workshop of artists, especially painters and sculptors: it has its own studio; set up a studio; painting studio / film studio, project studio // craftsmen's workshop: photographic studio; fashion studio salon; studio for art photography",
  predgovor2: "Atelier Max Zaxter already in its design exceeds the limitations of the present definition, as it is not limited to conventions, generally accepted interpretations and accepted social norms. The values and modus operandi of this studio go beyond, as written in this linguistic norm. Max Zaxter's studio represents not only the physical space in which the artist creates, but also a metaphysical unit, within which elements of free-thinking spirit, unusual ideas and ideas are spontaneously intertwined from the very beginning. All that is also accompanied by a copious measure of hedonism, which in this context turns out to be the mildest euphemism. The values and work of the studio reflect the love for everything beautiful, good and tasty, the boundless joy of life, freedom in all its manifestations, and at the same time the expressed desire for the superfluous is realized. The whole concept of the studio can thus be easily perceived as an artistic experiment. An experiment in which the central role is played by the imperative of how to bring art closer to people - people of all castes, worldviews, different academic backgrounds, artistic preferences, styles and tastes. Art seeks to bring the user closer to him in the way his eyes and soul see him, while not neglecting the primal sensations and aesthetic value that the individual himself ascribes to the products. How to learn, to give a picture a dot on i that as a work of art is perceived as something more .... And it is precisely this question that for the most part employs the central protagonist of the studio alongside his artistic creation and gives him a strong wind in the sails ...",
  quote1: "I like the picture mainly because it contains a soothing composition of colors, which has a positive effect in the work environment and at the same time reminds you that it is necessary to swim forward all the time.",

  quote2: "Custom-made paintings nicely complement and enrich my personal collection. The painter listens very well to the wishes of the client, and at the same time adds his personal touch to the art.",
  quoteAuthor2: "Maja Lawyer",
  quote3: "I bought the painting because i immediately “saw” it on the living room wall. It reminds me of my grandfather and thus of my childhood, and on the summers when I sail the seas. Colorful and technical, the picture is very convincing. On top of all that, I also bought it as an investment.",
  quoteAuthor3: "N. Pečenik employed in public administration",
  quote4: "As soon as a friend showed me Rosetti’s work, I simply had to have it at home on the wall. Considering that I have been a big fan of motorbikes and petrol fumes since I was a child, and that I simply can't do without an motor, I couldn't resist the picture. Even today, when I look at the picture on the wall, I can not believe how the painter hit all the details and showed the motorbike on the canvas in real action, as if he were sitting on it.",
  quoteAuthor4: "Klemen salesman I. S. T. Avto deli d.o.o",
  quote5: "I like the dynamism of the image and the choice of colors itself. The image is not monotonous, but is the exact opposite. On the wall, when I look at it, I feel as if I see the motorbike actually sailing through the air.",

  quote6: "With interpretation artist Max Zaxster helps us to notify and to appreciate what is especially worth - nature, cultural heritage - art through the eyes of some famous Slovene artists. I like this picture above very much because of the selection of colours and composition. Regardless of this, it lightens the entire place in an in-country living room always, if the sun shines a light on it or it is being hidden in darkness.",
  quoteAuthor6: "Mitja Krajnc",
  collagio1: "Surrealism in the current paintings of Max Zaxster represents a distinct individuality and at the same time his unusual view of the works of art of artists of different spaces and times. The puzzles or leaflets of various past works by many artists act as an enigmatic challenge to the viewer, while at the same time their new and completely autonomous interpretation. The rebus, which suggests the urgency of reflection and the challenge to the image observer, is intertwined with the impression of the existence of a deeper message somewhere in the background. Observation leads to reflection on several mathematical puzzles, rebuses, crossword puzzles, and tabloid news. The seemingly cinematic narrative, and the related interpretations of the works of many authors, quite quickly manage to seduce the observer to conflict within their own opinion. The multi-layered nature of the painting presents a challenge and new expectations, perhaps also about what is still around or perhaps behind. What is where at all.",
  collagio2: "The painting is presented to the viewer as an externally crowded gallery, perhaps even an antique shop, the usual selling price, even without a clear path, relations to the artistic circumstances of all time in without an eminent curator who would obviously authoritatively determine the content of viewing. Suddenly, only painting in its most profane interpretation becomes before our eyes, and it deeply symbolizes the present world - the world of a headless market, endless overloaded shelves with necessary and unnecessary, more for the eyes than for people. Every piece of the observed urban environment has experienced the same, the advertising bubble is more and more bigger, everything has been too much for a long time, and at the same time there is far too little endless and uncertain travel in search of inner satisfaction.Under the endless pressures of the media, a lot of information, even false information, we become more stubborn and insensitive to that tiny latent feeling that allows us to sublimely experience the visual impulse, the mixture of lights and shapes. The smell of beauty. ",
  collagio3: "Running along Zaxster's puzzle, searching for possible answers of his own, may be reminiscent of the modern dramaturgy of shopping. Reliable on browsing the web and social networks. In fact, in his fragments of paintings, our eye sometimes misses only the indication of discounts and selling prices of fragments of these paintings of his. Aware of the painting chaos, it portrays, it tackles various interventions that represent a search for the whole and at the same time a departure from the interpreted paintings, sometimes a commentary, sometimes just a specific relation or even a kind of author's aversion. He even goes so far as to look from behind and roughly reach into the canvas with a knife.",
  collagio4: "A narrative rebus, a traveling theater, a shopping center, a storeroom art, an antique shop, or just a daily experience of the World Wide Web, are lined up in pieces like recordings of a recent dream. It is a distinct individuality that deeply denies the known existing practices, an unusual, perhaps even a fairy-tale experience of the painting world and the world in general. Painting suddenly adapts completely spontaneously, merges into the images of sales catalogs of shopping centers and even reminds of design practices that sting the eyes of the audience daily. Whether it’s Zaxster’s own land called Oz or just her current reflex in the ordinary world - it’s probably both.",

  asociacija1: "As so many times before, we always seem to face the fundamental question, what are the criteria that determine whether a certain painting is of artistic value or not and what exactly defines art in its core. In the painting titled Association there is a collage of works from different painters as follows: Lojze Logar - David's Gardens, Franc Kokalj – Holy mountain and Matej Metlišek – Newspaper. The artists all share a similar perception of life which reflects itself in the similarity of style and expression of their art. They use strong colours, but simple shapes, and most importantly, they paint out of love for art and creativity. In paintings they use different techniques on oil, stained glass and acrylic.",
  asociacija2: "This painting was created as a collection of their works and gives rise to the association about faith, love and mortality. Like many who are in search of the causes of our existence and exploring our true nature, we can lean on the words of Antoine de Saint-Exupéry from The Little Prince, “the essence is invisible to the eyes”. The painting presented definitely points out the significance of our life quest, where only few can recognize its true essence. It is a very expressive and colourful painting, filled with purity, positivity and simplicity. The background of the painting is similar to the optical effect or phenomena displayed by the mineraloid gemstone Opal, where two basic colours, blue and red, were purposely chosen. To this two basic colours, a flowing mixture of both is added as a neutral colour.",
  asociacija3: "This ultimately strikes a balance between the left and right part of the painting. And last but not least, the details in this painting are not as important as the recognition of the technique and style of the Max's painting and all the hidden that this painting is “associating“ with.",
  solucija1: "The painting Solution is the artistic depiction of Andy Warhol’s works, who was a famous American artist, film director, illustrator and a writer. It is evident he had an artistic gift in several fields, which is without a doubt seen in all his work. He was recognized all over the world and is also known as an art pioneer and a founder of the visual art movement known as pop art. His best and most common works are seriographies: Shoes, Camouflage and Marilyn Monroe. In his works, he expressed the values of a capitalist society, such as fame, splendour and success, which all still exist in today’s society. He was also known as a good speaker. One of his most interesting sayings are: “an artist is someone who produces things that people don't really need at all“ ; “if you don't want to be real, you don't have to do the right thing“; “if everything in the world is done with machines, then I will think as a machine.“ With these words he showed how far art can go in relation to people's desires and longings for certain artistic creations that deviate from ideals. Warhol was certainly a special soul, which is also proved by the fact that he had 25 cats and he named them all  Sam. Many years after his death his work is still relevant and as Eric Shiner, a director of his museum, said: “He's still in the game, a commercial art genius would be very happy about that.“",
  solucija2: "The biggest challenge for our society is for each of us to accept our own taste, to express our true desires and find a way to stand out as a sign of protest against social boredom. In this creation, Max Zaxster flirts with Warhol's modern philosophy, where he tries to capture a pattern that Warhol used in his paintings. Of course, Warhol’s style is unique and one of a kind, which reflects in symbols he used and their deeper meaning.",
  solucija3: "Warhol's solution for artistic expression lies in the “multiplication“ of material symbols and people of the modern age. A unique and unrepeatable creativity, inadvertently forcing us to think about the meaning of art and of artists who were creating before him, and especially after him.",
  evolucija1: "We sometimes wonder what makes a certain painting a work of art. What is this factor that distinguishes average art from a masterpiece? It may be pleasing to the eye or you can sense some strong emotions radiating. Many questions rise up that cannot leave you indifferent. Max's painting titled Evolution consists of works from following painters: Pieta Mondrian, Gustav Klimt, Jean-Claude Christosn and Vasily Kandinsky. In studying different patterns, we realize that there are infinite combinations. When we look at a picture for the first time, a pattern is quickly revealed to us according to the characteristic of each author’s style. The presented painters knew how to achieve balance, in terms of both, design and colour, which they were able to portray very masterfully. Max’s goal in depicting Evolution was  to capture the basic traits of the painters mentioned above that led them to their development and recognizability of style. The motif focuses on an individual’s perception of an art, however, it is the philosophy of life, which is expressed through the mind of an artist, that is important. ",
  evolucija2: "Evolution depicts selected motifs sharply and robustly, while acrylic involves fine, soft details. The colour palette consists of three basic colours: red, blue and yellow. Purple provides colour balance with its spectral power. The most dominant is pure red, while other colours are gradient. The red colour has a wavelength of 630-760 nanometers, which makes it the most visible. It emits power and is charged with energy. It also corresponds to expansive emotions. Blue is a colour of peace and harmony, a colour of high values and trust. You could say it’s an emotional “sedative”. Its aura gives meaning to personal relationships. It symbolizes water - the sea, in the Orient and India it symbolizes faith in gods. Its wavelength is 450-495 nanometers. The yellow colour has a wavelength of 570-590 nanometers. It also appears as a symbol of the sun - light, emotions and care for others. Yellow attracts attention. This is mainly why it appears at the beginning of the image. It increases communication, inspires us with hope, optimism, happiness and gives us a touch of humour. The colour of the third chakra is yellow and so is the flag, which means quarantine. In Feng Shui, yellow turns to gold. The golden colour represents strength.",
  evolucija3: "With this painting, the author wants to draw attention to the art world of his personal choice and sympathy. The depicted motifs of painters are known all over the world, therefore the viewer will at once recognize their unforgettable style.",
  interpretacija1: "What is art? Who can claim that a particular painting is an exceptional work of art? What is that which gives art greatness? The answer lies in the characteristics of a painting, in its colours, symbolism and the energy of an artist. There are also other very important factors, like the environment in which a drawing is created and the way paint is applied to the surface with a paint brush.",
  interpretacija2: "The painting titled Interpretation is a collection of several different painters and their work: Metka Kraševec, Jože Tisnikar, Leon Zakrajšek, Silvester Plotajs Sicoe, Zvesta Appolonia, Jože Ciuha, France Slana and an interpretation by Max Zaxster. Individual characters, themes, styles and other characteristics of a certain painting mark and define Max’s view of their work and inner components. It is extremely difficult to perfect or define a certain style, without copying the image itself, choosing the appropriate colour and feel or realize what the artist was thinking at that particular moment. Historically exceptional works were created as a result of everyday problems and difficult times in which artists seem to find deep inspiration.",
  interpretacija3: "Why this particular selection of images? Mainly because Max saw certain similarities that he connected, the harmony of strong colours and significant symbols which artists interpret their relationship to the world with. His interpretation of the painting, in which he combined the works of all the mentioned painters, reflects his vision of the world, as he believes colours express much more than words. This painting sets out questions about the circle of life and death and how the sun always shines behind dark clouds. A display of dark and light motifs and a crow as a symbol of something new show this everlasting contrast. The line runs in the form of infinity, from the beginning of abstraction through realistic scenes. It ends in a golden triangle, which represents an artistic abstraction. The purple flag appears in the picture for a reason. Mainly because purple is perceived as a very intense colour with deep meaning. It is a colour with its own light spectrum between 380 and 450 nanometers. It is perceived as a very pleasant colour, which has the shortest wavelength among all the colours of the spectrum that the human eye can still detect. It symbolizes pride, royalty, luxury and unconventionality. The purple aura means that the individual devotes himself to visionary matters. It ranks sixth in terms of world’s most popular colours.",
  parodija1: "The painting titled Parody depicts two excellent works of painters from the USA: Kevin Hill and Justin with the same surname. They use strong colours as they use all the given possibilities of a painting palette. An average viewer probably does not recognize all the mystique hidden in the painting, but sees only two excellent depictions of nature and mountains. The picture is much more than that. A viewer has to delve into it and feel the depths into which it invites us. It is important to ignore everyday worries and let the soul enjoy the sight of these beautiful colours and playfulness of nature.",
  parodija2: "There are times in life when everything goes smoothly. And there are times when something unexpected happens. A “knife” appears that cuts us in the “middle,” and hurts us to the very soul. The consequences of this cut can make us or break us. It can turn us into a good or a bad person, but just like the picture shows, we need to get away from the “knife”. Otherwise it can “cut off“ our deeper part that stays separated from us forever. The paintings of the above authors symbolize this separation. Will we be able to stay in a colourful world throughout our lives and remain on the path to paradise? Or will the path take us to a dark and troubled world? Red colour expresses this dark world which is hard to avoid and where our wounded soul can stay trapped in its current state of consciousness. The sole purpose of depicting enraptured, almost allegorical scenes of nature is the painter's warning to avoid the “cutting knife“ in those critical moments in life and his guidance to prefer to hold the hand of Mother Nature, that gently strokes and comforts, through the help of painter's depiction.",
  parodija3: "Max’s creation can also be understood as a parody of artworks, whose common motif and sole purpose is to please. Idealized depictions of nature can also have a therapeutic purpose, as they have the power to heal “wounded souls” and return us to a world of serenity and satisfaction. The realization, that an idealized painting motif on a wall can be the best remedy, when we feel unwell or discontent, represents a parody of the modern world, which offers us superficial and quick solutions to achieve happiness, contentment and well-being",
  poklon1: "The painting titled A gift depicts works by painters Jože Tisnikar and Teodor Tavželj. Why is it called A gift? This is a painting, in which Max wanted to show his respect for the wonders of nature. He focused on sea salt marshes, which are among the most endangered wetlands in the Mediterranean. We live in a technologically oriented and nature unfriendly society, where rich life of different ecosystems, including salt marshes is disappearing. The coastal salt marshes are very important for Slovenia not just because of rich animal life in these areas but also because of 45 species of plants from the red list of endangered species of Slovenia that also grow there. ",
  poklon2: "Max points to the ecological problems of the modern world in his own artistic way. He used symbols he “borrowed“ from paintings of the painters mentioned above.  His depiction of Tisnikar's crow illustrates the imminent decline of nature and its riches. The same fate awaits the famous European shag (Phalacrocorax aristotelis), a typical bird of the Mediterranean salt marshes, which sadly nowadays only rarely decides to nest in these areas. They remind us that the technological world wants to carelessly rob us of the beauty of the salt marshes. The red, yellow and orange colour illustrate this danger, as well as how nature has to fight with itself due to the indifference of men. In his painting Max symbolically depicted all our hopes in the form of the air bubbles floating and waiting for better times. Then the black crow will no longer stare so threateningly and reproachfully at us and life in the salt marshes under the blue sky will again become calm, exuberant and colourful. The colour spectrum has a calming effect on us, which inspires the observer with positivity. The colours are deliberately soothing, so that they bring a touch of joy into us, as if we were standing by the salt marshes and feeling a light breeze that hugs us.",
  poklon3: "A lot of established and amateur painters got a creative inspiration from an art mentor Teodor Tavželj, who knows the salt marshes and the Slovenian coast very well. Max's work is a tribute to the idea that only with a painted motif can we arouse enough noble emotion and feeling in people, which increase their self-awareness and activity toward the preservation of natural resources. That is why Max's recreation as well as work from other artists who warn and raise awareness with their works deserve special attention as they all represent A gift to art.",
  outremer: "Some collect travel impressions with a camera, but a real rarity are those who take a sketchbook with them on the trip. A sketchbook accumulates impressions with a pencil, especially those that require a little more attention and contain special details. That final painting, which will later be created on the basis of sketched impressions in the home studio, is a set of deep impressions from lands beyond the sea. The sketchbook is just as important to the artist as the canvas on which the painter's work is finally created. The final shapes, colors and strokes were created in the artist's head at the time when the first impressions got their shape in the sketchbook. The impression that is imprinted in the artist's memory, however, contains something that we feel more in the painting than we see.",

  aboutMax: "Max Zaxster the artist who inspired us in choosing the name of our studio. He has been creating for our studio for several years. He has already created many works in it. Some are already decorating the walls of apartments and offices, others are still waiting for new enthusiasts Max is known that loves traveling and exploring and from the gained impressions he creates impressive works. In each of his works, we can also recognize the hidden messages he wants to reveal and share with all who discover their philosophy of life in his creations. By nature, he is an exalted dreamer, who wants to recognize the positive in everything he discovers and experiences. He is known for being particularly impressed by the sea and its scents, which is why this motif often appears in depictions. There is a well-known anecdote about that, how Max once put up a canvas on the beach and waited for inspiration. Suddenly he felt a light gust of wind with a slight taste and the smell of salt, algae and pine. Then - as if an invisible force was holding his hand. He painted and painted, applied colors and brush strokes blended with each other. When the painting was finished, he looked up and could not believe that he could paint such a picture in such ecstasy. For this event, he still says, he doesn’t remember planning and thinking about what he was supposed to paint that day. He only remembers being surrounded by an invisible force guiding his hand. In this way, painters often create unforgettable impressions, which reveal to our eyes not only the magical image of nature, but also the emotional depth of the artist's perception of time and the world.",
  aboutMario: "Mario is always a special person. He didn’t manage to find himself for really until he discovers his talent for painting. Even as a child he loved to tased his father. He loved to color his dad face whit the pattern of motor tire while he was sleeping. He was motorcycling enthusiast since he was a child like his father. . That is why there is no surprise that Mario got his first motorcycle for his 12 birthday. From little motorcycle he soon switched to the real one. But happiness didn’t last. In a huge accident he almost lost his life and leg. But the doctors save him. The consequences, however, left him to give up his professional motorcycling career.This accident marked him for whole life because he was only capable of admiring the motorcycles. The leg was to damage to ride a motorcycle. Due to his accident which deprived him from riding a motorcycle is one of the main reason for starting painting motorcycles. When painting motorcycles he is taken back by all the unforgettable memories he had from riding motorcycle and the wind he felt. He experiences something similar every time he grabs a brush, which seduces him across the canvas in an unbridled rhythm. While he resounds the sounds of engine, the brush absorbs the force of air resistance, through which his body cut. His knees pressed tight against torso to tame a wild stud between his legs, for not losing control like he did in the accident and due to which was he pushed to roadside ditch, where his barely started dreams of boundless freedom ended. Each painting is a continuation portray of that moment in roadside ditch, which would almost be his end, but due to his endless love for freedom and creation, was an announcement of a new start. One day we visited him for ordering one of his paintings for our studio. He waited us with his helmet on his head. When questioning him about that, he explained that this is how he empathize with and it makes him to feel like he is really riding a motorcycle. From the background we could heard the loud sound of winding motors coming from TV. We questioned him about that, and he gave us an interesting reply: “while listening to the sound of a motor engine, I get extremely inspirited, I simply feel like the whole world has stopped just for me. For me it feels like the time when I was on the motorcycle and drove carefree into the distance. The surrounding around me is starting to disappear and I can only see the road I am driving and the beat of my motorcycle between my legs.” In case you ever find yourself by his place, don’t be surprised by the smell of the gasoline. In his studio there are still parts of motorcycle or what was left of him. Mario Rosetti faced his life trauma in a very interesting way. He doesn’t push it to the depth of his subconscious, but it keeps it with painting of everything that he is deprived from.",
  aboutUla: "We present you another special soul, whose character perfectly suits the other artists in the Max Zaxster studio. You could say we found ourselves together after many years and finally felt the closeness of kindred spirits. There are periods when she is not in the mood to create and when she would not be convinced even by a bunch of money. She creates when she feels catharsis and consequently inspiration. Ula mentioned an event that happened not long ago. While driving on the highway, she got the inspiration for the painting. She stopped in the parking lane, pulled her painting equipment out of the trunk, and began painting. The resulting image was provocative, like the image of Ula along the highway with cars speeding past. Ula is a big animal lover. She is the owner of a canary, named Kandinski. Vasilij Kandinski is one of her role models. The canary is so colorful that he simply had to get his name. Ula is most disconnected from the real world when she creates abstract images. She says that painting to her is a kind of meditation. As she devotes herself to the painting and the overflow of different colors, her soul completely &quot;disconnects&quot; from her body and sometimes, only when the painting is finished, she sees what she has actually created. Spirituality has a special meaning for Ula. When she creates various affirmations and mandalas, special feelings flow through her body. In that moment she is touched by some supernatural force. In the past, she created a very special mandala for a person suffering from cancer. All the colors and patterns that appeared in her head were attuned to the sick person. Shortly after the painting was handed over, the patient&#39;s health began to improve dramatically. Ula says it’s important for an individual to stare at such a mandala for at least half an hour a day and meanwhile disconnect from the real world. Then the soul moves from the physical world to the world of light, where extreme energies are created in the astral body. These turn into something miraculous when they return to the physical body. Of course, an individual must be mentally open to such things, otherwise one may create a blockage in ones body. In such case, the energies from the world of light will not reach the physical body, but will bounce off it like arrows from an iron shield. Ula finds it difficult to open the door to her creative world to someone from the outside. It also took quite some time for the team of our studio to make contact with her and bring her under our auspices. So how to describe Ula G. Lipowitz in a few words? Talented, special, spiritual, and above all, extravagant. All these qualities give her a special charm, because in her works you can find so many secrets, which allows you to see completely different ideas in the picture. With her paintings, we can easily wander into her spiritual world and learn the secrets that she has revealed to us in her paintings with the help of creatures from the metaphysical world."
